# Electric Vehicle Range Prediction

This mini project uses machine learning to predict the electric driving range of EVs based on their specifications.

## 📌 Project Summary
- Predicts EV range using features like battery capacity and energy consumption.
- Built with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Scikit-learn.
- Uses models like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Explains predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
